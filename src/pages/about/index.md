\[ '' ironically, we accept life isn't constant , we still look for everything fixed " - Energies ]

Reading page number 36 of Life. 

Courage to see yourself.

Awareness will make your life simpler.

Knowledge is real accolades.

Confidence is your cloth.

Conquer what is yours.

Life's lessons are simple but we complicated it with our choice. Now most of us are lost, there are reason for everything understanding the energies will make your life simpler. 

What you will get? well let me very clear nothing or everything you wish for.

If you can face yourself without being bias you will find friend who will teach you how to be owner of happiness.
