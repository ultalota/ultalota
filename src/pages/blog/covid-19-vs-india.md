It is tough to get along with strangers before Covid19 outbreak Hopefully, we still do it and feel it strong about our get along behavior.

Dealing with the unknown and invisible threat! is difficult?!

Threat? the threat of life and healthy survival.

The threat of life and Survival is so valid we don't know who our enemy is? was it a Biological weapon or not, as a human being I want to know the truth.

''Humans must know that their survival is important'', anyone who care and share the same idea or agree on said will be contributing fight against 'the unknown'.

Take it seriously, and make everyone aware of it. washing hands is new mantra of life along with social distance.

How India is fighting with the unknown.

Get know <https://www.mohfw.gov.in/>

In brief,

With the population 133.92 crores (2017)

The no of cased found is 152, new cases 9, death of 3 elderly with the medical history, recovery of 14 and are in-home quarantine for 28 days, active cases among found cases are 135 with 0.1 cases /million population.

Hopefully, on the next NPR, we will be surprisingly on top population country thus there is delaying of NPR  however,

With'so-called' common challenges with education, health & hygiene, cleanliness awareness, and welfare standard the current stage with covid 19 is an exceptional achievement!

India has been fighting well if compared with the developed nations.

Swiftly, airlifted Indian citizens from Epic center also, 'we care' attitude, airlifted neighboring citizens too.

Taking strong step closing the door from china and started screening passengers flying from China.

Gradually, increase the number of checkpoints meanwhile, covid 19 breaking stage II to Stage III in short time Europe made  it to WHO, 'who' stating it as pandemic!

And it did turn Pandemic

It was called too late, many started flying home while the door was open for the unexpected return from a different country of Europe.

And this brings us on stage II

How we are dealing with Stage II ?

With careful steps.

Checking and touching the individual coming from outbreak country stage III.

Stage III where the footprint is lost and no trace of spread i.e. community spread. Lockdown on human movement in certain areas with no trace of affected or not.

India picked most of its citizens from abroad, considering stage II & III. Softly blocking, the door via canceling the visa. limiting the air travel and gradually to mobilisation(will get into details soon)

India has been 1st country to lend a helping hand to China 

Sending the team of doctors abroad for Indian citizens.

Gifting the testing equipment to Iran.

India initiated the helping hand to keep the neighboring country clean and aware at the same time releasing funds for them in case of an emergency.\
Setting up an example from humanitarian hand irrelevant on the differences that exist between arch rivals. be it on airlifting pakistan's citizen and taking care of them till deflated SAARC was pumped to life on human touch.

While Indians being Criticize as a country of divided can look closely human beings and humanity are at prime for their citizen. compared to the developed nation.

Humanity is a religion of democracy.

Never forget to appreciate the heros - Doctors and scientists along with authority standing on the toe 24x7 wide eye open to make it possible.
