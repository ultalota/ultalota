It is tough to get along with strangers before Covid19 outbreak Hopefully, we still do it and feel it strong about our behavior.

Dealing with the unknown and invisible threat! is difficult?!

Threat? the threat of life and healthy survival.

The threat of life and Survival is so valid we don't know who our enemy is? was it a Biological weapon or not, as a human being I want to know the truth.

''Humans must know that their survival is important'', the other who care and share the same idea or agree on said will be contributing fight against 'the unknown'.

In brief,

How India is fighting with the unknown.

Get know<https://www.mohfw.gov.in/>



With the population 133.92 crores (2017)

The no of cased found is 152, new cases 9, death of 3 elderly with the medical history, recovery of 14 and are in-home quartine for 28 days, active cases among found cases are 135 with 0.1 cases /m population.



Hopefully, on the next NPR, we will be surprisingly on top of the world!

With'so-called' common challenges with education, health & hygiene, cleanliness awareness, and welfare standard the current stage is an exceptional achievement!

India has been fighting well if compared with the developed nations.

Swiftly, airlifted Indian citizens from Epic center also, 'we care' attitude picked neighboring citizens.

Strongly, closed the door from china and started screening passengers flying from China.

Gradually, increase the number of checkpoints meanwhile, covid19 breaking stage II to StageIII in short time in Europe made WHO stating it as pandemic!

And it did turn into one!

It was called too late, many started flying home while the door was open for the unexpected return from a different country of Europe.

And this brings on stage II

How we are dealing with Stage II with phenomenal steps.

Checking and touching the individual coming from outbreak country stage III.

Stage III where the footprint is lost and no trace of spread i.e. community spread. Lockdown on human movement in certain areas with no trace of affected or not.

India picked most of its citizens from abroad, considering stage II & III. Softly blocking, the door via canceling the visa.

India has been 1st country to lend a helping hand to China and sending the team of doctors abroad for Indian citizens.

Gifting the testing equipment to Iran.

India initiated the helping hand to keep the neighboring country clean and aware at the same time releasing funds for them in case of an emergency.

While Indians being Criticize as a country of divided can look closely human beings and humanity are at prime compared to the developed nation.

Humanity always is a religion of democracy. Never forget to appreciate the unsung hero - Doctors and scientists along with authority standing on the toe to make it possible.
