On the last day of exam,\
I gathered all my courage,\
to put my mind to ask,\
May I take a picture of ur’s for my memory?

My question was one sided,\
I am no mean,\
but I had no choice,\
to preserve my memories with time.

Please take, the voice said,\
in a jiffy,\
“Only you can see both us together”\
Your two eyes are for me .

It was so difficult to hold my composure,\
stop shaking my mind,\
for these eyes which just managed to stop tears ,\
Nothing can replace that feeling .

No claps,\
No coins,\
No walks,\
No prayers,

Thanks I said and turned away,\
Telling myself to stop till ,\
I find the cool shade of a lonely tree,\
who is as helpless as me,\
doing his bit,without asking anything.

This picture is the best,\
As I can actually read it ,\
to my blind friend , Ramesh.\
And can make him smile.

This is picture perfect still says my mind !
