Open your eye, look left look right,

In herd of sheep black and white, you are brown, long face and pale eye.

All are shouting 'the sky is falling'  Don't you rush glare up give your conviction  space for your sight.

Have faith, if its stone or green sprouting life nothing exists for the closed eye. Believe, in your existence! your senses will extend 
horizon,  identify your life.

 For a while,  it is tough and exhausting but nothing is free in our life.

Mesmerize the rise, dawn is the teacher embrace it with a smile, 

grow your soul, there is only happiness where wisdom lie.

All will measure with the scale of their choice,

 you are unique - the paradox, not like a parakeet but phoenix,

 face the fire ashes will mold you right,

 just spread your wing to fly high!
