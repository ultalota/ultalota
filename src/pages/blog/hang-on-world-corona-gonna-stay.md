The Indian model on covid19 is designed in an exclusive way to deal with the pandemic. Precisely to explain and the way it should be implemented in a populated country.

India is a hugely populated country.

 The model is voluntary. 

Covid19 is imported contamination(does not originate from India), which leads to stage 1.  As India is 2nd largest country on population, developing country, democratic country and with a good percentage of rich and poor( imbalance of rich and poor poster makes it developing nation) Understanding the above- Indians are very social, culturally inclined, 12 months in a year there are some festivals and events on full throttle(default socialization)

Indians enjoy cultural freedom, they are mobile on religious tours and tourism i.e. foreign and domestic. vibrancy is just amazing!

Indians are good at business, as globalization explanation has been inculcated in rich ancient history, country have utilized the open door policies with grace and expanded the business and relations out of the country as well.

The most important struggle is to keep covid19 infection at the minimum level and the pandemic to the controllable stage. India is very much prone to be at a vulnerable stage quickly escalating it to stage 3&4 in the blink of an eye!\
As, medical and medical R&D are not high on budget and keeping it as it would come, ignorant for gradual requirement, although medical facility are  quality and minimum compared to developed countries. ironically, people are exploding every night to make it tough for most of common issues. 

why in the blink of an eye?

 Indians enjoy freedom like no other democracy would, exceptions are always there still, Indian are more culturally and religiously driven, basic scientific methods are least valued. 
Education and measurement on scientific importance & value are not the same, living and method of living aren't the same, hence, one can have an argument that will go endlessly, Indians fail to differentiate black and white most of the time due to mentioned factors.


Meanwhile, getting stage 2 is almost certain as people from outside come to the 'home' and one has to be at home when world is struggling to keep human alive.

Understanding the paracetamol is important , while India started the thermal check post people coming/returning home they cheated the investigation. Gave birth to the idea, to keep track of these, stage1 carriers while tracing leftovers cheater who were enjoying the relief with loved ones to self-quarantine and Banning the Paracetamol in every medical store in the country. The move is to make people aware and they identify themself with the symptoms, report them to the officials.

As many say testing will help, practically that is possible but looking at the bigger picture will help you to swallow your larva that the whole world is in crisis. Test kits are damn expensive and it will not give the surety of one being positive or negative on one go it has to be multiple on single case. Practically very tough to implement and not cost effective with all economic activity on zero.

Lockdown is the only efficient method to contain the spread.

Being honest to him/herself for life and loved ones have to be the priority. This is the war on the human race and existence. Survival is the key and most of the fears are eating lockdown humans are of uncertain future which holds the past and present of Coronavirus.

The whole world has to understand this Virus is alive or now living and it is with us and gonna stay! This is a certain future we should be preparing for, life will not remain the same as it was before until the cure or vaccine comes in rescue.

Life has to be planned with health and hygiene at the cost of life.
